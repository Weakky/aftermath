A script engine made for last year's high school.

Parser handles all kinds of expressions, including relationals, mathematics, loops (for, while), functions, assignments etc..

You're even allowed to add own custom functions to the script language. It currently owns a function to evaluate algorithmic expression and draw it on a frame, or to print all kind of stuff to a local console.

The whole AST can be displayed through a treeview, showing how the code was parsed.

The project was completely free to choose. It received a grade A.

Code wasn't touched for years, it may not compile at all.
